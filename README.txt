>> DoublyLinkedList class:

- I chose integer as the data type of the doubly linked list class I created.
- The swapWithSuccessor() uses other helper methods such as findNode(), PrintAll(), and swapNodes() for simplicity and to be able to use them in the demo of the main method and What each method does is expained as comment above the methods.
- To use the demo, Run the main method directly and please follow the instructions.
- The run time explanation and the major concept of the algorithm is explained in the class's first line of comments.

>> For the written part of the assignment, to avoid ambiguous interpretartions of the questions, i have indicated the assumptions I made 
and possible scenarios.

>> For BinarySearchTree class, i have included Demo which can test out all the methods in addition to the DoublyLinkedlist demo. It has
an easy format to follow.

>> For both classes, I have added the node class as a sub-class instead of separate Node class for easy implementation.

Thank you for reading!
